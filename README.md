[Demo](https://rtinit.github.io/rss-virtual-keyboard/deploy/)

## Functional requirements:

- [x] design is at your discretion
- [x] index.html file should be empty (all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS)
- [x] pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard
- [x] keystrokes are animated
- [x] clicks on the buttons with a mouse on the virtual keyboard and pressing keys on a physical keyboard should input symbols to the text area located on the page above the virtual keyboard.
- [x] pressing the Up, Down, Left or Right arrow key inputs an arrow symbol in the input field, or implements navigation on the text area.
- [x] pressing the Enter should move a text cursor to the next line
- [x] the Tab key creates a horizontal indent
- [x] pressing the rest of the function keys on a keyboard does not result in inputting symbols
- [x] the Backspace key removes character before the text cursor
- [x] the Del key removes character after the text cursor
- [x] the Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Caps lock and Space keys should work as on a real keyboard

## Technical requirements

- [x] should work on the latest Chrome version
- [x] usage of JQuery and other JS libraries is not allowed
- [x] usage of Bootstrap and other UI libraries is not allowed
- [x] usage of Angular/React/Vue and other frameworks is not allowed
- [x] you can use CSS preprocessors
- [x] ESLint (eslint-config-airbnb-base) should be used. It is allowed to add to the .eslintrc.js file ignoring the 'import/extensions' rule in case of using modules and needing to import them into the main file.
-[x] the working application should be hosted on GitHub Pages. It happens automatically on 'gh-pages' branch creation. Afterward, the page will be available at the address like https://your-github-account.github.io/name-of-your-repository
